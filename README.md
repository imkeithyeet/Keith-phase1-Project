 Keith Ma's Phase 1 Project



1.For my first project, i initially wanted to use a a public API that includes over 100 memes for the main content. It was good idea at first but didn't want 
to deal with filtering out to only a few memes i wanted for my first project. So i decided to use a custom API that has the specific memes that i wanted and the information within it. 

2.After I decided with my own Api, I wanted to use that content with a shopping website layout which goes well hand to hand with what I wanted. 

3. I started implementing three event listeners that was most crucial and important when it comes to a shopping store website. First was having a circle mouse-move event that can help a ot of people see where the cursor is going, second is the submit form which every website needs to have to search for items,and third was clicking event for the plus and minus qty elements.

4. I had used four meme pictures for my content and later on fixed the layout and styling of my website through CSS.


A simply yet effective shopping website layout that implements the project guidelines.
